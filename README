The significants about data. it's a history.
Backward compatbility is about where we come from and how it was built in the first place. It's an appreciation of all the world can be reuse again.
When we have more advanced technology, skill and knowledge it can re-adopt to the old technology and run it see if does it run better than what it was before or was only just make certain things... easier (or lazier)
So it's better? with more data captures in many different way or is the core comes from knowing how to use those data and make easier chocies for us?
some choices are optimial which I think I am really interested. but some of them just explain and pure emotionally. the balance or not so balance is just a personal preferences.


The limiting factor. What limits there is a way. when the limit uplifted where does it end?
I think it might be faster more efficent (maybe). it might save some time might save some space. 

We built a lot, coventionalize a lot. but it doesn't captures the outliers. To explorer and discover the already discover might sound sily.
But as long if was once new. then maybe it was worth the time investgating, to try, to do.

Hopefully learn a lazier way to do the thing when retrying. maybe change a few parameters (but you should probably change only one parameter at a time).

and left no one behind.
